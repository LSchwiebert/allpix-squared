### Description
Adds a weighting field (Ramo field) to the detector from one of the supported sources. By default, detectors do not have a weighting field applied.
This module support two types of weighting fields.

#### Weighting field of a pad

When setting the **pad** model, the weighting field of a pixel in a plane condenser is calculated numerically from first principles, following the procedure described in detail in [@planecondenser].
The weighting field is dervived from the weighting potential as

$` E_w^{x,y,z} = - \frac{\partial \phi_w}{\partial (x, y, z)}`$.

The integral part of the expressions for the weighting field and potential are ignored.
In [@planecondenser] it has been shown that the uncertainty on the weighting field is smaller than

$`| \Delta E_w^z | < \frac{V_w}{8\pi} \frac{w_xw_y}{d^3} \frac{1}{N^2}`$,

where *N* limits the expansion of the series.
In this implementation, a value of $`N = 100`$ is used.
Following these calculations, the z-component of the weighting field is given by

$`E_w^z/V_w = \frac{1}{2\pi}g_z(x. y, z) + \frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{n = 1}^N\left[g_z(x, y, 2nd + z) + g_z(x, y, 2nd - z)\right] `$

with

$` g_z(x, y, u) = \frac{x_1 y_1 (x_1^2 + y_1^2 + 2u^2)}{(x_1^2 + u^2)(y_1^2 + u^2)\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2 + u^2}} + \frac{x_2 y_2 (x_2^2 + y_2^2 + 2u^2)}{(x_2^2 + u^2)(y_2^2 + u^2)\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2 + u^2}} + \frac{x_1 y_2 (x_1^2 + y_2^2 + 2u^2)}{(x_1^2 + u^2)(y_2^2 + u^2)\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_2^2 + u^2}} + \frac{x_2 y_1 (x_2^2 + y_1^2 + 2u^2)}{(x_2^2 + u^2)(y_1^2 + u^2)\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_1^2 + u^2}} `$

with $`x_{1,2} = x \pm \frac{w_x}{2} \qquad y_{1,2} = y \pm \frac{w_y}{2}`$. The parameters $`w_{x,y}`$ indicate the size of the collection electrode (i.e. the implant), $`V_w`$ is the potential of the electrode and *d* is the thickness of the sensor.

The *x* and *y* components of the field are determined in the same way, i.e. by calculating the derivatives of the weighting potential.

#### Weighting field map

Using the **init** model of this module allows reading in from a file in the INIT format, e.g. from an electrostatic TCAD simulation.
A converter tool for fields from adaptive TCAD meshes is provided with the framework.
The field is expected to be symmetric around the reference pixel the weighting field is calculated for.

A warning is printed if the field size does not correspond to a multiple of the pixel size.
While this is not a problem in general, it might hint at a wrong field map being used.


### Parameters
* `model` : Type of the weighting field model, either **init** or **pad**.
* `file_name` : Location of file containing the weighting field in the INIT format. Only used if the *model* parameter has the value **init**.
* `output_plots`:  Determines if output plots should be generated. Disabled by default.
* `output_plots_steps` : Number of bins along the z-direction for which the weighting field is evaluated. Defaults to 500 bins and is only used if `output_plots` is enabled.
* `output_plots_position`: 2D Position in x and y at which the weighting field is evaluated along the z-axis. By default, the field is plotted for the position in the pixel center, i.e. (0, 0). Only used if `output_plots` is enabled.

### Usage
An example to add a weighting field via an INIT file to the detector called "dut" is given below.

```ini
[WeightingFieldReader]
name = "dut"
model = "init"
file_name = "example_weighting_field.init"
```
