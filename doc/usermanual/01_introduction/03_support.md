As for most of the software used within the high-energy particle physics
community, only limited support on best-effort basis for this software
can be offered. The authors are, however, happy to receive feedback on
potential improvements or problems arising. Reports on issues, questions
concerning the software as well as the documentation and suggestions for
improvements are very much appreciated. These should preferably be
brought up on the issues tracker of the project which can be found in
the repository \[[@ap2-issue-tracker]\].

Since Allpix Squared is a community project that benefits from active
participation in the development and code contributions from users. Users
and prospective developers are encouraged to discuss their needs either via
the issue tracker of the repository \[[@ap2-issue-tracker]\], the forum
\[[@ap2-forum]\] or the developer's mailing list to receive ideas and
guidance on how to implement a specific feature. Getting in touch with other
developers early in the development cycle avoids spending time on features
which already exist or are currently under development by other users.
