This Getting Started guide is written with a default installation in
mind, meaning that some parts may not apply if a custom installation was
used. When the `allpix` binary is used, this refers to the executable
installed in in the installation path. It is worth noting that before
running any simulation, ROOT and (in most cases) Geant4 should be
initialized.
