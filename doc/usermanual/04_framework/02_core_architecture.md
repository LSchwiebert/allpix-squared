title: "Architecture of the Core"
weight: 2

The core is constructed as a light-weight framework which provides
various subsystems to the modules. It contains the part of the software
responsible for instantiating and running the modules from the supplied
configuration file, and is structured around five subsystems, of which
four are centered around a manager and the fifth contains a set of
general utilities. The systems provided are:

1.  **Configuration**: The configuration subsystem provides a
    configuration object from which data can be retrieved or stored,
    together with a TOML-likeÂ \[[@tomlgit]\] parser to read configuration
    files. It also contains the configuration manager which provides access
    to the main configuration file and its sections. It is used by the module
    manager system to find the required instantiations and access the
    global configuration.

2.  **Module**: The module subsystem contains the base class of all
    modules as well as the manager responsible for loading and executing
    the modules (using the configuration system).

3.  **Geometry**: The geometry subsystem supplies helpers for the
    simulation geometry. The manager instantiates all detectors from the
    detector configuration file. A detector object contains the position
    and orientation linked to an instantiation of a particular detector
    model, itself containing all parameters describing the geometry of
    the detector.

4.  **Messenger**: The messenger is responsible for sending objects from
    one module to another. The messenger object is passed to every
    module and can be used to bind to messages to listen for. Messages
    with objects are also dispatched through the messenger.

5.  **Utilities**: The framework provides a set of utilities for
    logging, file and directory access, and unit conversion. A set of
    exceptions is also provided in the utilities, which are inherited and
    extended by the other components. Proper use of exceptions, together
    with logging information and reporting errors, makes the framework
    easier to use and debug.
