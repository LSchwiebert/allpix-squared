The latest version of can be downloaded from the CERN Gitlab
repositoryÂ \[[@ap2-repo]\]. For production environments it is recommended
to only download and use tagged software versions, as many of the available
git branches are considered development versions and might exhibit
unexpected behavior.

For developers, it is recommended to always use the latest available
version from the git `master` branch. The software repository can be
cloned as follows:
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared
cd allpix-squared
```
